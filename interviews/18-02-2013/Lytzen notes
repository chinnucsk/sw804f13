User + password gonna be on the API server and Lytzen will make the rest down to the call manager.


Architecture sketch is correct



Presens / Jabber is the easiest way to get the call list and maybe redirect calls.

Skype call with Christian about protocols and servers.


Call manager is gonna get Rooted, so we can debug and see whats happening


Lytzen står for gateway.
